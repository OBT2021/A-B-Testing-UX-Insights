## 📁 Project Overview

This project explores how webpage design impacts user behavior and conversion performance. DigitalPath Innovations, a digital marketing company, conducted a two-week A/B test to compare two webpage versions: **Version A** and **Version B**. 

An interactive dashboard was developed in **Tableau Public** to evaluate the effectiveness of each version across multiple engagement and conversion metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify which version (A or B) drives better user engagement.
- Analyze the full user journey — from landing to purchase.
- Compare engagement and conversions across referral sources.
- Provide actionable insights and design recommendations.
- Benchmark metrics against e-commerce industry standards.
